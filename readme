This project aims to help effectivity of refactoring by analysing git repo as a graph.
Currently the script runs on a repo given as run argument.

The current modeling is that each change is a node, there is an edge between nodes if the change is in the same commit or of it is to the same function

Most of the heavy lifting is done by networkx- for graph computation and pydriller for git crawling.
